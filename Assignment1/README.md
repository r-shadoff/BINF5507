Assignment 1: Data Preprocessor

datapreprocessor.py contains four data preprocessing functions that take a pandas dataframe as input, and output a cleaned pandas dataframe. The four functions include imputation of missing data, removal of duplicates, normalization of numerical columns, and removal of redundant features. The functions can be applied individually or sequentially to generate a cleaned dataframe.

main.py contains the code that applies data preprocessor functions to a messy dataset (messy_data.csv) , resulting in a clean dataset (clean_data.csv).

To run datapreprocessor.py, download the Scripts repository and replace the messy data filepath in main.py with the filepath of your messy dataset.
